# eunuch.vim

Vim sugar for the UNIX shell commands that need it the most.  Features
include:

* `:Remove`: Delete a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
* `:Unlink`: Like `:Remove`, but keeps the now empty buffer.
* `:Move`: Rename a buffer and the file on disk simultaneously.
* `:Rename`: Like `:Move`, but relative to the current file's containing directory.
* `:Chmod`: Change the permissions of the current file.
* `:Mkdir`: Create a directory, defaulting to the parent of the current file.
* `:Find`: Run `find` and load the results into the quickfix list.
* `:Locate`: Run `locate` and load the results into the quickfix list.
* `:Wall`: Write every open window.  Handy for kicking off tools like [guard][].
* `:SudoWrite`: Write a privileged file with `sudo`.
* `:SudoEdit`: Edit a privileged file with `sudo`.
* File type detection for `sudo -e` is based on original file name.
* New files created with a shebang line are automatically made executable.
