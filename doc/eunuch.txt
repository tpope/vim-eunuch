INTRODUCTION                                    *eunuch*

Vim sugar for the UNIX shell commands that need it the most.  Delete or rename
a buffer and the underlying file at the same time.  Load a `find` or a
`locate` into the quickfix list.  And so on.

COMMANDS                                        *eunuch-commands*


                                        *eunuch-:Remove* *eunuch-:Unlink*
:Remove[!]              Delete the file using the method specified by
:Unlink[!]              |g:Eunuch_rm| and reload the buffer.  If you change
                        your mind, the contents of the buffer can be restored
                        with |u| (see 'undoreload').

                                                *eunuch-:Delete*
:Delete[!]              Delete the file using the method specified by
                        |g:Eunuch_rm| and |:bdelete| the buffer.  This cannot
                        be undone, and thus a `!` is required to delete
                        non-empty files.

                                                *eunuch-:Copy*
:Copy[!] {file}         Small wrapper around |:saveas|.  Parent directories
                        are automatically created.  If the argument itself is
                        a directory, a file with the same basename will be
                        created inside that directory.

                                                *eunuch-:Duplicate*
:Duplicate[!] {file}    Like |:Copy|, but the argument is taken as relative to
                        the current file's parent directory.

                                                *eunuch-:Move*
:Move[!] {file}         Like |:Copy|, but delete the old file and |:bwipe| the
                        old buffer afterwards.

                                                *eunuch-:Rename*
:Rename[!] {file}       Like |:Move|, but the argument is taken as relative to
                        the current file's parent directory.

                                                *eunuch-:Chmod*
:Chmod {mode}           Change the permissions of the current file.

                                                *eunuch-:Mkdir*
:Mkdir {dir}            Create directory {dir} and all parent directories,
                        like `mkdir -p`.

:Mkdir                  With no argument, create the containing directory for
                        the current file.

                                                *eunuch-:Cfind*
:Cfind[!] {args}        Run `find` and load the results into the quickfix
                        list.  Jump to the first result unless ! is given.

                                                *eunuch-:Lfind*
:Lfind[!] {args}        Run `find` and load the results into the location
                        list.  Jump to the first result unless ! is given.

                                                *eunuch-:Clocate*
:Clocate[!] {args}      Run `locate` and load the results into the quickfix
                        list.  Jump to the first result unless ! is given.

                                                *eunuch-:Llocate*
:Llocate[!] {args}      Run `locate` and load the results into the location
                        list.  Jump to the first result unless ! is given.

                                                *eunuch-:SudoEdit*
:SudoEdit [file]        Edit a file using sudo.  This overrides any read
                        permission issues, plus allows you to write the file
                        with :w!.

                                                *eunuch-:SudoWrite*
:SudoWrite              Use sudo to write the file to disk.  Handy when you
                        forgot to use sudo to invoke Vim.  This uses :SudoEdit
                        internally, so after the first invocation you can
                        subsequently use :w!.

                        Both sudo commands are implemented using `sudo -e`,
                        also known as sudoedit.  This has the advantage of
                        respecting sudoedit permissions in /etc/sudoers, and
                        the constraint of not allowing edits to symlinks or
                        files in writable directories, both of which can be
                        abused in some circumstances to write to files that
                        were not intended.  These restrictions can be lifted
                        with the sudoedit_follow and sudoedit_checkdir sudo
                        options, respectively.

                                                *eunuch-:Wall* *eunuch-:W*
:Wall                   Like |:wall|, but for windows rather than buffers.
:W                      It also writes files that haven't changed, which is
                        useful for kicking off build and test suites (such as
                        with watchr or guard).  Furthermore, it handily
                        doubles as a safe fallback for people who, like me,
                        accidentally type :W instead of :w a lot.

DELETION                                        *eunuch-deletion*

                                                *g:Eunuch_rm*
                                                *g:Eunuch_rmdir*
You can customize how |eunuch-commands| will delete files and directories by
setting your own values for the global variables `g:Eunuch_rm` and
`g:Eunuch_rmdir` respectively.

You can specify a String, a List, or a |Funcref|.  A string will be called as
a system command with the file's path as its only argument:
>
  let g:Eunuch_rm = 'trash'
<
Lists will be interpreted as the name of a system command, and arguments to
pass to it.  The file's path will be the final argument:
>
  let g:Eunuch_rmdir = ['rm', '-rf']
<
A |Funcref| will let you perform more customized operations:
>
  function! MyDelete(path)
      echo "deleting " . a:path
  endfunction
  let g:Eunuch_rm = function('MyDelete')
<
Eunuch uses Vim's |delete()| function by default.  The default configuration
is:
>
  let g:Eunuch_rm = {path -> delete(path)}
  let g:Eunuch_rmdir = {path -> delete(path, 'd')}
<

PASSIVE BEHAVIORS                               *eunuch-passive*

If you type a line at the beginning of a file that starts with #! and press
<CR>, The current file type will be re-detected.  This is implemented using a
<CR> map.  If you already have a <CR> map, Eunuch will attempt to combine with
it.  For best results, use an <expr> map.

Additionally, if the shebang line lacks a path (e.g., `#!bash`), it will be
normalized by adding `/usr/bin/env` (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env bash`).  If it
lacks a command entirely (just `#!`), Eunuch will invert the process and pick
a command appropriate for the current file type.  For example, if the file
type is "python", the shebang will become `#!/usr/bin/env python3` .

Finally, adding a shebang line to a new or existing file will cause `chmod +x`
to be invoked on the file on the next write.

                                                *g:eunuch_interpreters*
You can customize the generated shebang with g:eunuch_interpreters, a
dictionary that maps between file types and shell commands:
>
        let g:eunuch_interpreters = {
                \ 'lua': '/usr/bin/lua5.1'}
<
This example is a joke.  Do not use Lua.
