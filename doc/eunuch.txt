INTRODUCTION                                    *eunuch*

Vim sugar for the UNIX shell commands that need it the most.  Delete or rename
a buffer and the underlying file at the same time.  Load a `find` or a
`locate` into the quickfix list.  And so on.

Since this plugin can delete files, you should be aware that this plugin can
delete files.  Fat fingers beware.

Bonus feature: if you create a new file that starts with #!, `chmod +x` will
automatically be invoked on it when you first write the file.

COMMANDS                                        *eunuch-commands*

                                                *eunuch-:Unlink*
:Unlink[!]              |:bdelete|, and, if successful, delete the file from
                        disk.  If a bang is given, it is passed along to
                        :bdelete.

                                                *eunuch-:Remove*
:Remove[!]              Alias for |:Unlink|.

                                                *eunuch-:Move*
:Move[!] {file}         Like |:saveas|, but delete the old file afterwards.

                                                *eunuch-:Rename*
:Rename[!] {file}       Like |:Move|, but relative to the current file's
                        containing directory.

                                                *eunuch-:Chmod*
:Chmod {mode}           Change the permissions of the current file.

                                                *eunuch-:Find*
:Find[!] {args}         Run `find` and load the results into the quickfix
                        list.  Jump to the first result unless ! is given.

                                                *eunuch-:Locate*
:Locate[!] {args}       Run `locate` and load the results into the quickfix
                        list.  Jump to the first result unless ! is given.

                                                *eunuch-:SudoEdit*
:SudoEdit [file]        Edit a file using sudo.  This overrides any read
                        permission issues, plus allows you to write the file
                        with :w!.

                                                *eunuch-:SudoWrite*
:SudoWrite              Use sudo to write the file to disk.  Handy when you
                        forgot to use sudo to invoke Vim.  This uses :SudoEdit
                        internally, so after the first invocation you can
                        subsequently use :w!.

                                                *eunuch-:W*
:W                      Like |:wall|, but for windows rather than buffers.
                        It also writes files that haven't changed, which is
                        useful for kicking off build and test suites (such as
                        with watchr or guard).  Furthermore, it handily
                        doubles as a safe fallback for people who, like me,
                        accidentally type :W instead of :w a lot.

                                                *eunuch-:Trash*
:Trash[!]               (only in Mac OS X) Like :Unlink but moves file to Trash.
